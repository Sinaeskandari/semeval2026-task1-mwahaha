It is the two-dimensional analogue of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\nTwo different regions may have the same area (as in squaring the circle); by synecdoche, \"area\" sometimes is used to refer to the region, as in a \"polygonal area\".\n\nThe area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size.

Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.\n\nPreparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. Archeological evidence of cooking fires from at least 300,000 years ago exists, but some estimate that humans started cooking up to 2 million years ago.\n\nThe expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery f\n\nTask: Write EXACTLY ONE punchy joke (1-2 sentences) connecting: \"open\" and \"fridge\".\n- Be clever, cynical, or ironic.\n- Do NOT explain the joke.\n- Output ONLY the joke.\n\n### Response\nJoke:", "generated_joke": "Why did I take my cooking skills back in time?

Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to land their discs in the higher-scoring regions of the board, particularly the recessed center hole of 20 points, while also attempting to knock opposing discs off the board, and into the 'ditch'. In crokinole, the shooting is generally towards the center of the board, unlike carroms and pitchnut, where the shooting is towards the four outer corner pockets, as in pool. Crokinole is also played using cue sticks, and there is a special category for cue stick participants at the World Crokinole Championships in Tavistock, Ontario, Canada.\n\nEquipment\n\nBoard dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately  in diameter.

This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using Bt genes, such as Bt corn. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal properties. The subspecies israelensis is commonly used for control of mosquitoes and of fungus gnats.\n\nA\n\nHeadline: \"Does painting cows with stripes prevent fly bites?

Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with  double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. Coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence.\n\nBuses may be used for scheduled bus transport, s\n\nHeadline: \"Best strollers for 2025, recommended by parents\"\n\nTask: Write EXACTLY ONE punchy joke (1-2 sentences) about this headline.\n- Be clever, cynical, or ironic.\n- Do NOT explain the joke.\n- Output ONLY the joke.\n\n### Response\nJoke:", "generated_joke": "What's next?

Sometimes a distinction is made between a balance of trade for goods versus one for services. The balance of trade measures a flow of exports and imports over a given period of time. The notion of the balance of trade does not mean that exports and imports are \"in balance\" with each other.\n\nIf a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a trade surplus or positive trade balance, and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a trade deficit or negative trade balance. As of 2016, about 60 out of 200 countries have a trade surplus.

The processing of food-grade agar removes the agaropectin, and the commercial product is essentially pure agarose.\n\nAgar has been used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work.

The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled; for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed, and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded unimpeded possession\n\nHeadline: \"The stunning touchdown that sparked the Titans' unlikely comeback\"\n\nTask: Write EXACTLY ONE punchy joke (1-2 sentences) about this headline.\n- Be clever, cynical, or ironic.\n- Do NOT explain the joke.\n- Output ONLY the joke.\n\n### Response\nJoke:", "generated_joke": "Why did the Titan's coach win the lottery?

This property could be useful, for example, to test for the presence of humans as CAPTCHAs aim to do, and for computer security to circumvent brute-force attacks.\n\nHistory\nThe term was coined by Fanya Montalvo by analogy w\n\nHeadline: \"AI joins list of global challenges on agenda for UN meeting\"\n\nTask: Write EXACTLY ONE punchy joke (1-2 sentences) about this headline.\n- Be clever, cynical, or ironic.\n- Do NOT explain the joke.\n- Output ONLY the joke.\n\n### Response\nJoke:", "generated_joke": "Because humanity's biggest challenge now is convincing AI we're still needed – just like our exes after breaking up! #ArtificialIntelligence #UnitedNations #ExFiles"}

A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference.
